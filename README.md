# Safari Explorer Project SpartaGlobal
### Project Goal:

>To create a three tier application, that allows a user to go on a safari and have a chance of encountering an animal. The user should be able to document information about the animal for later viewing.

### Project Defintion of done:

>The application should be able to communicate data between layers to enable the user to have a chance of encountering an animal. The user can then document thier findings which will be sotred within the database to allow them to view this data at any time.

#### Sprint 1: Foundation Of Project

>The goal of this sprint is to create the foundations of the project within github and visual studio. This sprint is all about setting up the correct enviorments in order for the next sprint to be created.

##### Sprint Retrospective:

###### Tasks that went well:
1. Was able to work consistently to figure out how to populate the database and chose to use the automatically filled ID’s instead.
2. Became more familiar with using GitHub extension within visual studio.
###### Improvements:
Get more familiar with using the .md formatting to fully utilise its full capabilities.
List things that went well,  improvements and action plan.

#### Sprint 2: Populate Database

>The goal of this sprint is to fill the tables within the database and create a random number generator corresponding to the database ID's.  Lastly display the information to the front end of the animal generated.

##### Sprint Retrospective:

###### Tasks that went well:
1. Changed the implementation of the table by using SQL instead of linq. Which allowed me to add data easily to the database.
2. Created the gui to show a random generated animal from the database.
###### Improvements:
Improve communication with my piers more so that I can get a better understanding of what went well during implementing. This additional information will allow me not to repeat the same mistakes they may have encountered.

#### Sprint 3: Additional pages to allow features to be implemented

>The goal is to create a gui that will hold the information created in the next sprint. This includes navigation via buttons.

###### Actions for not done:
Due to experimenting with migrations, a rebuild of the data table had to be implemented. Since the tasks where not essential to project success, they were left for the next sprint.

##### Sprint Retrospective:

###### Tasks that went well:
1. Researched and implemented frames so that I could use the inbuilt class “navigate” to move through the program via buttons and on click metods.
2. Through trial and error, migrations where implemented to update the database tables in order to facilitate the next sprint.
###### Improvements:
Develop better decision making when ordering the priority of tasks to be completed. In order to reach vital tasks in earlier sprints.

#### Sprint 4: Implement CRUD operations

>This sprints goal is to implement the CRUD operations in order to communicate the necessary data required through the layers.

###### End of Sprint:

###### Actions for not done:
Prioritised the most important tasks for this sprint, which resulted me moving non completed tasks to next sprint. Delete method not implemented, due to it depending on the add method.

##### Sprint Retrospective:

###### Tasks that went well:
1. Fully implemented the add/Update methods and created relevant gui logic around it to display a professional format to user.
2. Using git repo to revert to a working state of the program. When faced within multiple errors.
###### Improvements:
Starting project sooner or reavaluating task priority in product backlog would have allowed me to get more feedback on harder issues faced later on in the project.

#### Sprint 5: Test CRUD operations

>The goal of the sprint is to test the CRUD methods implemented in previous sprint to fulfil criteria in definition of done.

###### Actions for not done:
Prioritised the most important tasks for this sprints goal.

##### Sprint Retrospective:

###### Tasks that went well:
Fully implemented the add/Update methods and created relevant gui logic around it to display a professional format to user.
###### Improvements:
To get feedback from stakeholders and piers on the state of the program in order to facilitate necessary changes to the product.
